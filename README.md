# Row Counter (WIP)

A simple counter app intended for tracking rows in knitting/crochet projects. The design is largely copied from the Android app ThingCounter by Kai Langenbach (no longer available on the Play Store), but features have been removed or added according to my usage. Notable new features include fully custom counter colors (with hex code support), and sub-counters which can be used for tracking row repeats or other extra information.

Made with Vite. Host locally with `npm run dev`. Live hosting coming soon!
